# minecraft-launcher-updater
A simple script that installs / updates the minecraft launcher. I made this because it is sooooooo annoying to go to the minecraft website and download the deb then install it. Simple and easy below


# Setup:
Either clone the repository or download the latest [release](https://github.com/Doomsdayrs/minecraft-launcher-updater/releases/latest) source (and extract the release source))

Assuming you are in the right directory
```
chmod +x ./install.sh && ./install.sh
```

# Remove: 
Same as before in requirments
```
chmod +x ./uninstall.sh && ./uninstall.sh
```

# Usage:
From any terminal
```
update-minecraft
```
